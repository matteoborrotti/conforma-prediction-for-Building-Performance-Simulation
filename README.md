# Conforma inference for Building Performance Simulation

Building Performance Simulation extensively uses statistical learning techniques for quicker insights and improved accessibility. These techniques help understand the relationship between input variables and desired outputs, and they can predict unknown observations. Prediction becomes more informative with uncertainty quantification, which involves computing prediction intervals. Conformal Prediction has emerged over the past 25 years as a flexible and rigorous method for estimating uncertainty. This approach can be applied to any pre-trained model, creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets or intervals for model predictions. This study uses data from simulated buildings to demonstrate the powerful applications of conformal prediction in Building Performance Simulation (BPS) and, consequently, to the broader energy sector. Results show that conformal prediction can be applied when any input and output variables assumptions are made, enhancing understanding and facilitating informed decision-making in energy system design and operation.
